#    Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

#📋 Project Objective
Provide hospital administrators and clinical staff with a single‐page, at‑a‑glance view of key Emergency Room (ER) performance indicators, enabling data‑driven decisions to improve throughput, resource allocation and patient experience.

Specifically, the dashboard answers the following questions:

How many patients visited the ER this month?
→ The dashboard shows a KPI card displaying the total number of patients, which is 485.

How long did patients wait on average?
→ The average wait time is shown as 35.51 minutes using a KPI and trendline visualization.

What percentage of patients were admitted vs discharged?
→ The dashboard uses a stacked bar and donut chart to indicate that 52% were admitted and 48% were not admitted.

Are patients arriving on time or experiencing delays?
→ A donut chart visualizes that 61% of patients arrived on time while 39% experienced delays.

How does volume break down by age, gender and referral department?
→ Bar and column charts show the distribution of patients across age groups (highest in 70‑79), gender (51% female, 49% male), and department referrals (most referrals are 'None' and General Practice).

What is the overall patient‐satisfaction score?
→ The dashboard displays a satisfaction score of 4.71 out of 5 using a KPI with a trendline.
